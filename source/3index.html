      <p class="lesson1">
        This Bhagavad Gita verse teaches us that we should focus on performing
        our duties and actions without being attached to the results or
        outcomes. It emphasizes the importance of detachment and encourages us
        to do our best without worrying about the consequences.

        This helps us to stay focused on the present moment and perform our
        duties with sincerity and dedication, which in turn leads to better
        outcomes. Additionally, this verse teaches us to avoid the trap of
        inaction and laziness, reminding us that we have a responsibility to
        fulfill our duties and obligations in life.
